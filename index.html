        <h2><span>1</span> Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>
            <span>1.1<span> Goals
        </h3>
        <p>
            The ELA (Esoteric Language Explorer) application wants to give to anyone who thinks that has a uncommon way
            of thinking a challenge by providing all the possible information about esoteric programming languages.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
            <span>1.2</span> Structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            The application consists of a 2-pages web interface and a public SPARQL API. The web pages are designed for
            the human users, and the API can be accessed by other applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the pages is for completing a form where the user can decide what criteria should be fulfilled by an
            esoteric language. For example, the user wants to know about difficult esoteric languages, or esoteric
            languages that are based on <em>Brainfuck</em>.
            The list of criteria is dynamic, this means that the user will be able to add/remove items from the criteria
            list that is sent to the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other page is for interrogating the application for a random esoteric language. The page has a simple
            button that will send a request to the endpoint to return a random esoteric language.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SPARQL component represents a public endpoint that can be accessed by anyone. This endpoints provides
            two functionalitites:
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Retrieve an esoteric language that meets all the criteria/ requirements</li>
            <li>Retrieve a random esoteric language</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>A generic view of the application is as followed:</p>

            <h3><span>2.1</span> ELA-UI</h3>
            <p>
                The web pages will be implemented using <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS</b> and vanilla <b>Javascripts</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both pages will contain one thing in common, and that thing is a button/link that will redirect to the
                other we page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The requests executed by both pages will be done using <b>jQuery</b> in an asynchronous way.

                <p>
                    The page for getting a suggested esoteric language on criteria will have a dynamic form, with
                    buttons to add specific criteria elements (elements used in the ontology) and remove those elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The random page will have, beside the button that redirects to the criteria page, a button to send a
                    request to the application to receive a random esoteric language.

                <p>
                    Once the response is received from the server, if the HTTP reponse code is success (200), then the
                    page
                    will render a new HTML element that will contain information about the retrieved esoteric language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There can also be the scenarion when the application cannot find an esoteric language and an HTTP
                    error
                    code (404) is returned. In this scenarion, the UI will render a HTML element that will display the
                    result of the search.

                <h5><span>2.2.2.1</span> Criteria language</h5>
                <p>
                    This endpoint will receive an object will requested criteria to be processed.
                    Using the selected criteria, the web application will build the SPARQL query using the Jena
                    framework to execute it on the ontology.
                    Here are 4 scenarios that must to be handled accordingly:
                <ol id="ela-sparql-description-criteria-situations">
                    <li>The query returns one esoteric language: That language is returned</li>
                    <li>The query returns more than one language: A random language is chosen to be returned to the
                        caller</li>
                    <li>The query returns no language: the call returns the HTTP return code 404 - Not Found</li>
                    <li>For any error encountered by the server: the call returns the HTTP return code 500 - Server
                        Error</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

            <section id="ela-sparql-description-random">
                <h5><span>2.2.2.2</span> Random language</h5>
                <p>
                    The random generation is done by selecting random criteria. After the elements of the criteria are
                    selected,
                    those are filled with information from the ontology. The information extracted from the ontology is
                    limited.
                </p>
                <p> For example, if the criteria is <em>difficulty</em>, then the application
                    will extracted from the ontology the first 10 results for this criteria existent in the ontology,
                    and then chosen a random one. In the ontology, this criteria can have
                    the following values: <u>easy</u>, <u>medium</u>, <u>hard</u>, <u>very_hard</u>, <u>unholy</u>,
                    <u>why</u>. A random value from this list can be <u>why</u>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The return situations are similarly with <a href="#ela-sparql-description-criteria">Criteria
                        Endpoint</a>, with the exception that if no language is found, the criteria is re-generated and
                    the query is executed again.

            1. Use URIs as names for things

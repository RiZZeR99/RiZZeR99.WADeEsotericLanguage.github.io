        <h2><span>1</span> Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>
            <span>1.1<span> Goals
        </h3>
        <p>
            The ELA (Esoteric Language Explorer) application wants to give to anyone who thinks that has a uncommon way
            of thinking a challenge by providing all the possible information about esoteric programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our progress can be followed here, on the blog: <a href="https://elawade.blogspot.com/">ELA blog</a>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
            <span>1.2</span> Structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            The application consists of a 1-page web interface and a public SPARQL endpoint. The web page is designed
            for
            the human users, and the API can be accessed by other applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main pages is for completing a form where the user can decide what criteria should be fulfilled by an
            esoteric language. For example, the user wants to know about difficult esoteric languages, or esoteric
            languages that are based on <em>Brainfuck</em>.
            The list of criteria is dynamic, this means that the user will be able to select/unselect items from the
            criteria
            list that is sent to the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main page also has the option to generate random data to be sent to be web application in order to
            receive random languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a received language, the interface will display in the first phase a summary of the language, like the
            name. The user will have access to extend the information displayed in the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SPARQL component represents a public endpoint that can be accessed by anyone. This endpoints provides
            two functionalitites:
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Retrieve a list of esoteric languages that meet all the criteria/ requirements</li>
            <li>Retrieve information for a specific esoteric language</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>A generic view of the application is as followed:</p>

            <p>
                The web pages will be implemented using <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS</b> and vanilla <b>Javascripts</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The page will be divided in 2 section:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The above section, designed for setting preferences for the languages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The below section, for displaying information about the languages.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The below section will represent a list of the following items:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A summary about the language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All the details available for a language.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The requests called by the Javascript to the application server will be done using the <b><a

                <p>
                    The page for getting a suggested esoteric language on criteria will have a static desgin.
                    The criteria will be represented by fields in a form with predefined values. The user can select a
                    value, meaning that they want the
                    condition to be taken into account when retrieving languages, or not.

                <p>
                    Once the response is received from the server, if the HTTP reponse code is success (200), then the
                    page
                    will render a new HTML element that will contain information about the retrieved esoteric languages.

                <p>
                    There can also be the scenarion when the application cannot find an esoteric language and an HTTP

                    code (404) is returned. In this scenarion, the UI will render an empty HTML object.

                    The web application will provide two endpoints:

                    <li>

                    This endpoint will receive an object will requested criteria to be processed.
                    Using the selected criteria, the web application will build the SPARQL query using the Jena
                    framework to execute it on the ontology.
                    Here are 3 scenarios that must to be handled accordingly:
                <ol id="ela-sparql-description-criteria-situations">
                    <li>The query returns at least one language: the return code is 200 and the list of the languages is
                        returned with the number of found languages</li>
                    <li>The query returns no language: the call returns the HTTP return code 404 - Not Found</li>
                    <li>For any error encountered by the server: the call returns the HTTP return code 500 - Server
                        Error</li>

                <p>
                    This API uses the <em>GET</em> method in order to return the required language.
                    By using the REST approach, someone will need the name of the language in order to retrieve all the
                    date.

                <p>
                    The name of the language is extracted from the IRI, which is present in the body of the languages
                    retrieved by the <a href="#ela-sparql-description-criteria">Criteria

            3. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)
            <br>

            Our model follows those principles because:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The available resources (getByCriteria and getByName) are represented by the URL.
            </li>
            <li>
                The protocol used is HTTP with URL.
            </li>
            <li>
                The models are identified using their IRI <em>(International Resource Identifier)</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The resources will include links to related resources (compilers, authors, homepages etc.).
